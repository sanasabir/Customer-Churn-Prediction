# Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Business Problem
The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to churn. By understanding the patterns and behaviors leading to churn, businesses can proactively engage these customers and reduce churn rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. It contains customer information such as demographics, account information, and services subscribed.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Initial exploration to understand the dataset, followed by cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming and selecting features that contribute most to the churn prediction.
3. **Modeling:** Implementing and tuning multiple machine learning models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
4. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting customer churn, offering valuable insights into customer behavior. The results highlight areas for future improvements, such as enhancing feature selection and experimenting with advanced techniques.

## Future Work
- **Feature Selection:** Refine feature selection to improve model accuracy.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Explore ensemble techniques to boost prediction performance.
- **Neural Networks:** Implement advanced models like neural networks for potentially better results.
